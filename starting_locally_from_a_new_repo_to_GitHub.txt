We make a new folder outside the previous folder. 
here we create a new file and write some text in it. 

Right now this is not a git repo or connected to your git or GitHub account. To check if it connected you can simple type 'ls -la' in your terminal and see if there is any .git folder yet. If not then follow the rest. 

- Open up the terminal in this new folder and type:

~$ git init -b main

- Now do

~$ git status

- Notice an untracted file here.

- Go ahead and add the file

~$ git add .

~$ git commit -m "created a new file" -m "some description here about your commit"

- Try 'git push origin master'. What happened? 

- Because this not yet connected to a remote repo you get this error message. In other words you don't have 'origin'.

- To make a remote repo or origin let's go to GitHub and create a new repo. 

- Once you have created a remote repo, you have to connect it with your local new repo so that you can push. Now do the following in the terminal in this new folder:

~$ git remote add origin REMOTE-URL

- To verify what you just did do:

~$ git remote -v

- Now we have a connection between the local and remote or origin. So let's do:

~$ git push origin main

- Now, it is IMPROTRANT for your future commist to push to a right branch and not create errors. Therefore, we will do the following:

~$ git push --set-upstream origin <branch>

- Once you have set the upstream you can then just simply do:

~$ git push
