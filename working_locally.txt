--> if you are on Mac or linux you will already have git installed on your machine. so go ahead and open up the terminal.

In your terminal (~$) type:

~$ git --version

--> if you don't have git installed on your machine. Checkout Atlassian Git tutorial to install on your machine. 

--> another higly recommended thing we will do is to use the vscode editor. Of course! you can use any kind of editor you like...

--> go to vscode official website and download vscode acording to your machine.

--> Once you have git installed and an IDE (text editor ;) ) we can start working locally.

--> Follow instructions in the file How_to_add_SSH_keys.txt

# On your local computer:


~$ ls -la 

This will list all the files and directories inside this folder. 
Notice a blue color .git folder. This keeps track of your changes locally or on your remote repo.

Now, let's make some changes to some already existing file(s). Once you are done, do 

~$ git status 

This will show all the files created or updated but haven't been saved in a commit yet. Now "commit" here means that git have not updated these changes. It is indeed keeping track that your have made some change(s).

In order to commit we do:

~$ git add . 

Later you can do git add with each single file that has been changed.

Let's do our first commit now! 

~$ git commit -m "my first commit!"

Now, let's update our github/remote repo. Do

~$ git push origin master

Now, let's check our reporistory online on github. Do you see any changes there?
