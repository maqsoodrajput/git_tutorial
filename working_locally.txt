--> if you are on Mac or linux you will already have git installed on your machine. so go ahead and open up the terminal.

In your terminal (~$) type:

~$ git --version

--> if you don't have git installed on your machine. Checkout Atlassian Git tutorial to install on your machine.

--> go to vscode official website and download vscode acording to your machine.

--> Once you have git installed and an IDE (text editor ;) ) we can start working locally.
