--> In order to clone over SSH (which is recommended) you need to add an ssh key. Following are the steps:
--> Before we start, repeat after me: DONOT SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY WITH ANYONE!!!!

- Pre ssh step do these in your terminal:
~$ vim ~/.gitconfig
if this is empty then you have to add a user name and email which you can use to push to your remote repo.
~$ git config --global user.name "Your name"
~$ git config --global user.email  your_email@example.com

# you can also hide your email ID. To do that, I would highly recommend follow this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3e19cwX6uY

once you have done that go to github offical documentationpage and follow the following steps 
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

1- copy:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

2- This generate SSH key. And asks you an address where you want to save the key. Let's stick to the default and press Enter
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_ed25519): 

3- It asks you to setup a passphrase. I highly recommend to setup a strong passphrase using some passowards generator...
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 

4- It will prompt the following message:
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

5- To check the address of your SSH keys, do this in your terminal:
~$ ls ~/.ssh

6- DONOT SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY!

7- We need now our PUBLIC key to setup SSH with your github/remote repo. Let's print our public key in our terminal by doing,
~$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

8- Copy this PUBLIC key starting from "ssh-ed25519 ...." and go to:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

9- Click on settings and further select "SSH and GPG keys".

10- Add your PUBLIC key and and give it a name such as "Primary". Hit save and you are good to go!

--> now you can clone via SSH
