--> Git Branching and merging

- When you create a new repo you are on the master/main branch.  

- In order to check your branch info type
~$ git branch 

- We will now create a new branch so that we can work on it separately and then merge it into the main/master branch. To create a new branch type:

~$ git checkout -b <name-of-new-branch>

- It will take you automatically to the new branch. Type 'git branch' and it will show you your current branch.
