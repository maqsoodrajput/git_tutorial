# Demo begins...

1- Go ahead and create an account on GitHub.

2- Once the account is created, click on new repository and simply create a new repo. 

3- In begining we work with web interface. Click on create a new file and give it a name as README.md

4- First thing we will do is to create a README file and write short description about the project, same as here :)

5- Click on "commit new file"! notice the commit message once you have created this new file.

6- Now we will update this file by simply adding some text in the same file. Once you have made changes to the file notice the new commit message!

7- Let's check the history of our changes. Notice that each change has a new identifier. 

8- Click on the commits and you will notice the plus '+' signs where you made changes. 

9- Now delete some line and save the changes by clicking on commit changes. 

10- Again, check the history and you'll see the deleted lines with '-' signs and red color. 

11- Now, let's work with our local machine. Goto the file 'working_locally'.

12- If you want to start from creating your own repo in your local computer first then goto file 'starting_locally_from_a_new_repo_to_GitHub.txt'
